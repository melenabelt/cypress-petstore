# Cypress API Testing Project

Welcome to your Cypress API testing project! This project is designed for API testing (Petstore) using Cypress. It includes scripts to help you run and manage API tests.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed on your system. You can download and install them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your system:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/melenabelt/wdio-ts-bootcamp-2/
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd DIRECTORY_NAME
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

## Scripts

This project includes two useful NPM scripts to help you with your API testing using Cypress:

- Run Cypress API tests:

   ```shell
   npm test
   ```
This command will execute your API tests using Cypress in headless mode.

- Open the Cypress Test Runner for UI-based API tests in Chrome:
  
   ```shell
   npm test
   ```
This command will open the Cypress Test Runner for UI-based API tests in the Chrome browser. However, since this is a project for API testing, it's recommended to use the npm test command to run your API tests in headless mode.

## Configuration

Cypress API tests can be configured in your Cypress configuration file (usually cypress.json). Make sure to configure your API tests according to your project's requirements.
